    <caption>Web Workers API
        A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

        What is a Web Worker?
        When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.

        A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the
        performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the
        web worker runs in the background</caption>
